# DirectX12-Luna
![SSAO Demo](Images/SSAO-Demo.png)


Demos and my exercise solutions from the [DirectX12 book](https://d3dcoder.net/d3d12.htm) by Frank D. Luna. Updated for VS2022 and C++ 20.

I've also made some optimizastions to the framework code such as using arrays instead of vectors and using vector::reserve() where appropriate.

## How To Run
Simply open the .sln fle for the demo you wish to run. (Tested on VS2022 17.11.2)
